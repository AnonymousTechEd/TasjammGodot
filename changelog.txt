Changelog:

Main thing I did today was creating an endless level generator. It just picks a random segment from the mapsections folder.

Otherwise I've just been learning Godot.

I also slapped some instructions straight in the game. I reckon we can revisit that later, but for now I think simplicity and speed is good.

I think it would be cool to have a lobby level with instructions, where you can experiment with the controls and the game starts when both players step on some platforms.

My suggestions for gameplay:
- A match last for a set amount of time.
- If one of the players fall off the map or goes outside the camera view, the other gets a point and the round resets, but match continues.
- Same for when the chaser catches the other player.
- At the end of the match, the person with highest score wins.
- Each time the round resets, the other person is 'it'
